This folder contains a jupyter notebook for image analysis workflow:

1. [Example_workflow_sequential_DNA.ipynb](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/Chromatin_Analysis_2020_cell/blob/master/sequential_tracing/ImageAnalysis/Example_workflow_sequential_DNA.ipynb) in this folder provide example scripts to analyze raw z-stack images for sequential DNA-FISH into spatial coordinates. 

    1. Initialize Cell_List class

    2. Segmentation for all field-of-views

    3. Create cell objects

    4. Crop sequential images for each cell

    5. Pick chromosomes

    6. Multi-fitting candidate spots for chromosomes

    7. Pick spots to acquire region coordinates

    8. Generate population median distance map / contact probability map

    9. Save processed data into single file for further analysis
